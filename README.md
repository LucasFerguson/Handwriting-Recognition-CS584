## Datasets
For now, datasets are stored in a One Drive folder
[here](https://iit0-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/nbaxley_hawk_iit_edu/EtW6kD2M6YBNvg9AGPC0L-cBM1f6evyl5a6kyOFdXgZVGw?e=fEVD7n).
Just download the zip files and then unzip them into the Datasets folder directory (see the README there)

## Python
Yet to decide on the version of Python we should use, but ideally set this up in
a venv environment to keep versions consistent across all of our machines. Do
```
pip install -r requirements
```
to install all the libraries we are using. The main ones are TensorFlow, Keras
and can't forget numpy and pandas
